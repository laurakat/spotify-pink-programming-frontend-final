This web frontend will allow you to search for an artist and display their Top 10 Tracks. 

If you are logged in with a premium account, you will also be able to play the tracks by clicking on them.

First install the live-reload web server using npm

```npm install```

Then start the web server

```npm start```

It will run on port 8000 by default but this can be changed by updating the package.json file

For the login to work, you will also need to run the *authorization_code* example from the [Spotify web-api-auth-examples](https://github.com/spotify/web-api-auth-examples) repository.

You will need to update the authorization_code/app.js file
* client id
* client secret
* redirect uri (ie http://localhost:8888/callback)

The client id and client secret can be generated by creating a [Spotify developer app](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/)

Finally, you will need to update the authorization_code/app.js callback function 

You should replace the redirect that exists inside the check for !error && response.statusCode === 200 with the below

```// we can also pass the token to the browser to make requests from there
  res.redirect('http://localhost:8000/examples.html?' +
    querystring.stringify({
      access_token: access_token,
      refresh_token: refresh_token
      }));
